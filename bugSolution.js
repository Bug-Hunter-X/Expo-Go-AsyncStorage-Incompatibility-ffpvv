Instead of using AsyncStorage directly, consider using a more robust and Expo-compatible solution, such as MMKV or AsyncStorage alternatives provided by Expo.  These libraries often offer better compatibility and performance within the Expo Go environment.  Additionally, make sure that your application's AsyncStorage usage is handled correctly to avoid potential data conflicts and unexpected errors.
